## .find() Mobile App Idea <h2>

The main idea behid Project 3 is to create a Mobile game app that will display a picture with a hidden character using React and React Native.

The past two projects we have been working with Web Apps, so we decided on the Final project to try something different.

## Value:
* Entertainment
* Encourages kids and adults to persevere and deeper focus if they cannot find the object or character right away. This packed seek-and-find game takes patience and effort.
* Setting Elapse
